# Sky-Store

Sky Store is an online plant shop
## Installation

node version ^18

npm i
npm run dev
```

## Enhancements & Challenges

1. Create a login/register page and functionality ðŸ˜…
2. Using browser local storage to store in-cart data instead of vuex store.
3. I could have been able to add pagination functionality if the API call I used was supporting the Limit and Offset params.
4. Add "click outside" functionality to close dropdowns when clicking anywhere else outside them.
5. Add snackbar whenever clicking on the "add to cart" icon.
6. Separate dropdown code into a separate component, and use this component inside the PlantsList.vue Component.
7. The logo in the header navigates to the home page.
8. Give more attention to responsive design (mobile and tablet).
9. Fix a bug I have in the filtering & sorting functionality.
